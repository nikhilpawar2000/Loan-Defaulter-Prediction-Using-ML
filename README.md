## About
In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical loan data and predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan. By utilizing a dataset containing various features such as credit score, income, loan amount, employment history, etc., we train and evaluate different machine learning models to identify patterns indicative of potential defaulters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains anonymized information about past loan applicants, including both successful repayments and defaults. It consists of [67463] records and [35] features. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be shared directly, but a sample dataset or a similar dataset can be used for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Features
The features used for prediction include:
- Interest Rate
- Loan Status
- Loan Amount
- Employment History
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Payment History
- and more

## Methods
We employed the following machine learning algorithms for prediction:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

Hyperparameter tuning  were applied to optimize the models' performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting loan defaulters.

## Results
The performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics, and the results demonstrated promising predictive capabilities. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of [86%] on the test set. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
